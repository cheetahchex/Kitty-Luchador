# 🐱 Kitty Luchador Chat Bot – El Gato Supremo 🤼‍♂️

**El Gato Supremo** is a whimsical PowerShell chatbot that embodies the spirit of a feline luchador. Whether you're looking for a meow-tivational quote or a dramatic wrestling-themed response, this bot is here to entertain—in both English and Spanish!

**Why?** Because I was practicing Powershell and Spanish, as well has experimenting with using AI to help with scripting, and this was the result!
